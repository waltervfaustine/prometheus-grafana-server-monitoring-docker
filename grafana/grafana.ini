# Grafana Configuration File

# [server] section: Configuration related to the Grafana server
[server]
# Port on which Grafana will listen. The default is 3000.
http_port = 3000  

# [security] section: Configuration related to Grafana's security settings
[security]
# Username for the Grafana admin user. Default is 'admin'.
admin_user = ${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER}  

# Password for the Grafana admin user. Uses an environment variable for secure configuration.
admin_password = ${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD}  

# DOCUMENTATION:
# 1. **[server] Section**: Configures server-related settings for Grafana.
#    - `http_port`: Defines the port Grafana listens on. Default value is 3000. This setting determines the port used to access Grafana in a web browser.
#
# 2. **[security] Section**: Configures security and authentication settings for Grafana.
#    - `admin_user`: Sets the username for the Grafana administrator account. The default value is 'admin'. Modify this as needed for your security requirements.
#    - `admin_password`: Defines the password for the Grafana admin user. It is recommended to use an environment variable (`${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD}`) to keep sensitive information secure. Make sure this environment variable is set in your Docker Compose file or `.env` file.
#
# 3. **Environment Variables**:
#    - `admin_password` uses the environment variable `${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD}`. This approach helps avoid hardcoding passwords directly into the configuration file. Ensure that the environment variable is properly set to provide the password securely.
#
# 4. **File Location**:
#    - Place this configuration file in the `./grafana` directory when using Docker Compose. This will map the file to `/etc/grafana` inside the container, allowing Grafana to use it during startup.
