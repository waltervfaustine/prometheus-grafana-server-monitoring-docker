# Docker Compose Command for Deployment Management

# COMMAND:
docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build -d
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# - `docker-compose down`: Stops and removes all containers, networks, volumes, and images created by the `docker-compose.yml` file.
#   - This ensures that no old or unused resources remain, providing a clean slate for the next deployment.
# - `docker-compose up --build -d`: Builds the Docker images if they do not exist and starts the services defined in `docker-compose.yml` in detached mode (background).
#   - The `--build` flag forces a rebuild of the images, ensuring that any changes in the Dockerfiles or configuration are applied.
#   - The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode, allowing the command line to be freed up for other tasks.
#
# USAGE:
# - This command sequence is useful for deploying updates by stopping and cleaning up existing resources, then rebuilding and starting fresh services.
# - Ideal for scenarios where configuration changes or updates to dependencies necessitate a clean restart of services.
#
# NOTES:
# - Ensure that Docker Compose is installed and properly configured in your system's PATH to use this command.
# - If you only want to rebuild and restart without removing resources, use `docker-compose up --build -d` alone.
# - Customize the command as needed to fit specific deployment needs, such as adjusting service names or build contexts.
#
# EXAMPLE:
# - Execute this command from the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file to effectively manage and deploy your Docker Compose setup.
